# Exercise: Feature Toggle

## Description

Imagine the following: a large hypothetical system is suffering from a lot of bugs. As such a need as arisen to be able to disable some features on the platform.
Your team has chosen you to create a rapid prototype API for enabling and disabling features at runtime. Below are requirements for the prototype.
Feel free to alter the requirements, as they mainly serve as inspiration - the Deployment step is also evaluated and can be priortized over some of the requirements
if needed.

## Requirements


With the language and tools of your choice; develop a prototype application that partially or fully encapsulates the features below:

**1. Develop an external facing API with 1-3 simple features**
  - These can be whatever you want, but they key is to make them simple. Something like an adder, counter etc.

**2. Develop an internal (admin) API that can be called by an 'admin' to create Feature Toggles**
  - You should be able to create and delete feature toggles
  - The toggles should reliably enable/disable any of the features you created earlier
  
**3. Develop a way for an 'admin' to see which Feature Toggles exist and their status**


## Deploying the application

It's up to you how you want to demonstrate the application (standalone or on a server), but it's a great way to show off knowledge of this particular part of development.
Whichever way you choose; instructions on how to run/use the application is much appreciated!

## Notes
- The Deployment step is also evaluated and can be priortized over some of the requirements if needed.
- You do not have to priortize implementing any kind of user authorization or login functionality
- You do not need to create any kind of frontend application for this task
