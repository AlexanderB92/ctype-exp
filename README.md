# Exercise: Feature Toggle

## Description

Imagine the following: a large hypothetical system is suffering from a lot of bugs. As such a need as arisen to be able to disable some features on the platform.
Your team has chosen you to create a rapid prototype API for enabling and disabling features at runtime. Below are user stories for the prototype.
Feel free to alter the user stories, as they mainly serve as inspiration - the Deployment step is also evaluated and can be priortized over some of the requirements
if needed.

## User Stories


With the language and tools of your choice; develop a prototype application that partially or fully encapsulates the features below:

**1. Firstly, the team needs a prototype API, that can be used to demonstrate the Feature Toggle functionality**
  - Alice would love a feature to send messages/email
  - Bob wants a feature to create a 

**2. John is one of the administrators, and he wants an API that can be used to manage Feature Toggles**
  - John wants to be able to create and remove feature toggles
  - John wants the toggles to reliably enable/disable any of the features you created earlier
  
**3. John is one of the administrators working on the system, and he needs a way to see which Feature Toggles exist and their status**

**4. The hypothetical client has several features, that are only being used part of the week/month/year, and would like a way to be able to schedule Feature Toggles.


## Deploying the application

It's up to you how you want to demonstrate the application (standalone or on a server), but it's a great way to show off knowledge of this particular part of development.
Whichever way you choose; instructions on how to run/use the application is much appreciated!

## Notes
- The Deployment step is also evaluated and can be priortized over some of the requirements if needed.
- You do not have to priortize implementing any kind of user authorization or login functionality
- You do not need to create any kind of frontend application for this task
